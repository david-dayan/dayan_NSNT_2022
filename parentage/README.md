# Readme for directory "parentage"

This directory contains all information and analyses for assigning parentage to offspring, and the development of the final pedigree used for downstream analysis.  

Final results (pedigree and fully cleaned up metadata) can be found in the parentage_results subdirectory.

It does not contain any downstream analyses that use the final pedigree.
