# Readme for directory "parentage"

This directory contains all information and analyses for assigning parentage to offspring, and the development of the final pedigree used for downstream analysis.  

Final results (pedigree and fully cleaned up metadata) can be found in the parentage_results subdirectory.

It does not contain any downstream analyses that use the final pedigree.

There are two notebooks. They contain the same code, but the one titled "parentage assignment" contains a lot of additional notes, discussion, and accounts of previous work on the project. The one titled "assignment_notebook" is the cleaned up version to attach as a methods supplement.
