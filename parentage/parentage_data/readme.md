# readme for directory "parentage_data"  
  
- This directory contains inputs and outputs for/from Cervus and Colony  
- Subdirectories are organized by offspring year, each subdirectory contains:  
    - all data required to run Cervus and Colony for a given offspring year  
    - unprocessed outputs from Cervus and Colony for a given offspring year  
    - processed Cervus and Colony pedigrees for a given offspring year  
    - final consensus pedigree for a given offspring year  
    - note that the same parents occur can occur across multiple offspring years, so all information for a given parent may be spread across multiple subdirectories  
- Input sets of parents and offspring (except for 2020) are exactly the same as those from Sandra  
    - 2020 uses new data, so there is no corresponding input/output data from Sandra  
- Input parameters (colony.DAT files, cervus .crv files, logs) are different from those found in Sandra's directories
